login :
here we have 2 roles  :
its dynamic  create an user roles table *
present roles thinking is (user,doctor)
while login they specify the role 

we are thinking initially they from the frontend side they clear the otp verification through the 
firebase latter on hit these login api with mobile number 
we return success message,token,role


in the home screen :

when the user login fetch the present co-ordinates *

2> our services :
   like (opd booking,video cunsultation,home checkup,Medical Equipment Rental,
    ambulence emergency service ,   labtestes......)
